# Project 3: Spots

Spots is a responsive web page designed to showcase a collection of different locations through images and descriptions. The project features a user profile section and a gallery of cards below. The design emphasizes a clean, user-friendly interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. 

Technologies and Techniques Used:

HTML5 Semantic Elements: Utilized <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> tags for better code organization and accessibility.
Flexbox and Grid Layouts: Employed both Flexbox and CSS Grid to create responsive and flexible layouts.
Media Queries: created a responsive design by adjusting styles based on screen width.
BEM Methodology: Used Block-Element-Modifier naming convention for CSS classes to maintain an organized structure.
CSS Pseudo-elements: Used ::before pseudo-elements to add icons to buttons without additional HTML elements.
Font Management: Downloaded and integrated custom fonts from Google Fonts. Used @font-face to specify font families and provided fallback options.

**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
